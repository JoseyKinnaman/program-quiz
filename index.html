          <h2>You should try JavaScript!</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript is the only programming language understood by all web
            browsers, making it the most common language for web and mobile
            development. Students who learn how to code in JavaScript will be
            able to create simple to complex web pages, add interactivity
            features to an existing site, and update pages quickly without
            reloading.

        <div class="ruby">
          <h2>You should try Ruby Rails!</h2>
          <p>
            Ruby is a programming language focused on simplicity and
            productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and
            easy to write. The Ruby programming language is most commonly used
            with the Ruby on Rails framework. Ruby and Rails are typically used
            by younger companies and startups, especially for building
            interactive web applications.

        <div class="react">
          <h2>You should try React!</h2>
          <p>
            React is a JavaScript library used to create dynamic, interactive
            user interfaces. It allows a site to quickly update many different
            elements at once, without reloading the page. Since its development
            at Facebook in 2011 it has exploded in popularity. In fact, a recent
            survey by the popular question-and-answer site Stack Overflow
            reported React's usage increased by over 300% in 2016 alone.
            Examples of companies and products that use React include AirBnB,
            BBC, Ebay, Facebook, Instagram, Lyft, Netflix, New York Times,
            Reddit, Nike, Pinterest, Paypal, and many more.

        <div class="c-sharp">
          <h2>You should try C#!</h2>
          <p>
            The C# ("C sharp") programming language is most commonly used with
            the .NET framework. Students who are well-versed in C# programming
            can use it to create client applications, database applications,
            distributed components, and much more. Students who learn C#
            programming and combine it with their knowledge of the .NET
            framework can target larger enterprises, government agencies, and
            companies serving enterprise and government clients for employment.
